    
Here is a shprt summary of what this project is about



    rdparse.rb: This file is a given parser that we got from our teachers, this is remaining unchanged and we do not need to change or actually understand it that well, we will use this to parse our language.

    simlang.rb: in this file we have the current parser on top (rdparse.rb) that we use, (it remains unchanged), then under that we do tokens that match different keywords and then we do certain things with it when it matches, we creeate objects here and then pass it to the classes file, its important that we only create and hanles things as objects here and do not do anyhing directly in this file, only pass it to classes file.

    classes.rb Here we define classes that takes the objects saved dowwn by our rules in simlang.rb, here we do stuff like artimethic stuff, comparisions etc.

    

    tolk.rb This file serves as the entry point for interpreting SimLang code. It initializes the SimLang interpreter and provides methods for reading and interpreting SimLang code from a file.
