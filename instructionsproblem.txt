The problem is that we have created a language "simlang" where we got a already done parser for it, the parser goes until row 173, then we have our class simlang that works as it takes tokens and then we have different rules for our program, we just fixed the artimetic part meaning that we could operate +,-,/,* in our program.

We now want an assign rule that could look like this "set #x to 2" where # indicates a variable and 2 is the value of that variable, we want to store the variables in a hash whihc should somehow be our scope, were not sure how to start with this, the rules part should save all values and send them as object to the class file which will do stuff with it.

Im not sure how to keep going, so what we wanna do is to for example "set #x to 2" and also "show: #x" to get out the value of #x which in this case is = 2. We need to handle this somehow with a hash where all the variables are stored, and in the rules save out the key and value to pass it to the class that handles the variables, but we dont know how, we need to handle everything in the classes file and the rules should only define rules and save the correct objects.

Im not sure what scope and variable handling is the easiest but we would prefer an easy soloution, thanks for everyone trying to figure this out and help!
